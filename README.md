The Oscilloscope Watch has all the features of a modern watch (time, calendar, alarm, etc...) combined with all the features of the popular Xprotolab (Oscilloscope, Waveform Generator, Logic Analyzer, Protocol Sniffer, Frequency Counter). The Xprotolab has been featured in several other online magazines, such as Hack a Day. and Elektor.

Features:

    Mixed Signal Oscilloscope: Simultaneous sampling of analog and digital signals.
    Advanced Trigger: Normal / Single / Auto, with rising or falling edge and adjustable trigger level.
    Meter Mode: Average, Peak to peak and Frequency readout.
    XY Mode (Plot Lissajous patterns or see the phase difference between two waveforms).
    Spectrum Analyzer with different windowing options and selectable vertical log.
    Horizontal and Vertical Cursors with automatic waveform measurements.
    Arbitrary Waveform Generator with Sweep on all parameters.
    Display options: Persistence, Different grid options, and more.
    Curve tracer function
